It has been referred to as the "most powerful company in the world" and one of the worlds most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.[10][11][12][13] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California.Together they own about 14 % of its publicly listed shares and control 56 % of the stockholder voting power through super - voting stock.The company went public via an initial public offering(IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.Google is Alphabet largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabets Internet properties and interests.Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions.These products address a wide range of use cases, including email(Gmail), navigation(Maps), cloud computing(Cloud), web browsing(Chrome), video sharing(YouTube), productivity(Workspace), operating systems(Android), cloud storage(Drive), language translation(Translate), photo storage(Photo), video calling(Meet), smart home(Nest), smartphones(Pixel), wearable technology(Fitbit), gaming(Stadia), music streaming(YouTube Music), video on demand(TV), artificial intelligence(Assistant), machine learning APIs(TensorFlow), AI chips(TPU), and more.Discontinued Google products include Glass, Google, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail. Google is known for its highly ambitious technological innovations aimed at solving humanity biggest problems.[17] Some of these innovations include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Brain).Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[19] and fourth by Interbrand.[20] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position. Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California. The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.[28] They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site.Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page ideas.Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry PagePageRank patent including a citation to Li earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a play on the word googol, a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.';

He attended New York University before moving (1999) to San Francisco, where he set up a company that used the Internet to handle the dispatching of couriers and emergency vehicles as well as taxis. In 2000 he first considered using text and instant messaging (based on the principles of dispatch software) as a way of keeping in touch with friends. Six years later he approached Williams and Stone with his idea; together they developed a prototype of what would become the Twitter platform. Dorsey posted the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006. The service, which allowed users to send messages no longer than 140 characters, quickly became a popular social networking hub as well as a mainstream form of communication. Dorsey served as CEO until October 2008, when he became chairman of the board. In that capacity, he was involved with Twitter’s initial public offering (2013), which raised $1.8 billion. ';
